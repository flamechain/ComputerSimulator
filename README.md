# ComputerSimulator

This is my project where I try and simulate a computers functions. This directory uses bin files for RAM, DISK, and EPROM. These files aren't compressed, but its the best extension to represent the contents. Open them up: They are all binary code that I made.

Read the docs to see major updates and major bugs.

There is also a file for information and sources from where I learned, and a quick summary of all the compenents from the CPU to the ALU to the GPU.
