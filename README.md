# ComputerSimulator

This is my project where I try and simulate a computers functions. This directory uses bin files for RAM, DISK, and EPROM. These files aren't compressed, but its the best extension to represent the contents. Open them up: They are all binary code that I made.

Read the docs to see major updates and major bugs.

There is also a file for information and sources from where I learned, and a quick summary of all the compenents from the CPU to the ALU to the GPU.

This is my repo for all of my computer simulators. What I mean, is that I made a fully functioning computer, but replaced hard-coded functions with python code.

| Name | Description | Bit | Last-Update-Date |
|-|-|:-:|:-:|
| MOS | My Operating System. First try, major learning curve. | 8-bit | Current |
||

Also my languages for ease of use: (Will Be Added Soon to GitHub)

| Name | Use | Compiles To | Description |
| MNL | User-friendly | ASM2, Python | Compiles to Python if you want to use this for real, and to ASM2 for MOS |
| ASM2 | Step-up from binary | binary | Similary to assembly, but with custom binaries. Can only use for MOS |
